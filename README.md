In this project, I wanted to learn how to develop an online store using new technologies :
1 - Typescript
2 - NextJS
3 - 3d interactive model (for main page on desktop) on mobile just gif format.
4 - stripe (payment.)
5 - nextAuth for authentication. (Google auth) for example.
6 - react-redux (redux-toolkit) - for state management.
7 - tailwind for css.
8 - react-tost library for simple and cute animation.
9 - sanity.

Thank's for watching.
